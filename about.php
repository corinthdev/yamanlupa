									It is a science-led development and holistic mission mode program that uses the principles and approaches of the Bhoochetana 
									(soil rejuvenation) program in India to improve rural livelihoods of smallholder and marginal farmers in the Philippines by 
									increasing productivity through the use of best-bet soil, water, crop and nutrient management options. To improve livelihoods 
									of rural smallholder farmers, and enhance food and nutrition security while maintaining healthy ecosystems, the Bureau of Agricultural 
									Research of the Department of Agriculture has adopted the Bhoochetana principles and approaches or Yamang Lupa program in strategic 
									rainfed areas. By increasing crop productivity of selected major crops in the pilot provinces through sustainable intensification and 
									market-led diversification of the farming systems, the program helped farmers’ experience 20% increase in their incomes. To support the 
									implementation of the Yamang Lupa program, ICRISAT in partnership with DA-BAR and DA-HVCDP, conducted capacity building activities for 
									members of the management, to build their capacity in implementing the program in the pilot regions. ICRISAT organized training and exposure 
									visits for the program management group to understand the nuances of Bhoochetana program in Karnataka State and ICRISAT’s research for 
									development programs in the drylands. Training on integrated crops and natural resources management was organized for young and potential 
									researchers-cum-leaders of the country to lead promising innovative strategies for boosting agricultural productivity while managing the 
									natural resources effectively and efficiently for the smallholder farmers. A training-workshop on soil sampling, analysis and mapping was 
									conducted with the support of DA-BSWM. Six scientific visits have been organized by ICRISAT and top executives and officials of the Consortium 
									Partners involved in the program took part in them for deeper appreciation of the Bhoochetana principles and understanding on the Yamang Lupa 
									program as well as to benchmark good planning and M&E practices promoted by ICRISAT. At the end of the exposure trips and visits, workplans for 
									2014-2015 of the three pilot regions were developed based on their learnings in India, concept of the Yamang Lupa program and experiences in 
									the Philippines. Through ICRISAT’s experiences and guidance, the Steering Committee (SC) and program management group (PMG) have been set up 
									both at the national and regional levels prior to the implementation of the program. To build awareness in the community, amongst farmers and 
									government officials working in DA and policymakers, ICRISAT has supported the conduct of the program launching in pilot regions through the 
									initiatives and cooperation of the regional technical working group. The management group has finalized the 2014-2015 work and financial plans
									 of the program and the program’s implementing guidelines and policies during the Steering Committee meeting held on April 11, 2014 at BSWM.
									  The group has also agreed to provide necessary guidance to those regions or provinces that will initiate the implementation of the program 
									  through the Local Government Units (LGUs). ICRISAT team provided on-ground guidance and participated in conduct of the Steering Committee 
									  meeting. ICRISAT developed a flow chart on program management and process documentation and program implementation eligibility with local 
									  government units (LGUs). This approach has been considered by the management group as a guide in dealing with interested LGUs to implement 
									  the program both in the municipal and provincial levels. In consultation with DA-BAR, DA-BSWM and implementing groups, ICRISAT has developed 
									  a poster, brochure and flyers with details of the program. They have been translated into the local dialect by the implementing groups headed 
									  by DA concerned offices & SUCs and distributed by the LGUs concerned.
